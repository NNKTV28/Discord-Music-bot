# Setup Lavalink
This bot is made so you can run it without having to modify anything apart from your bot token in config.env. In case you want to modify it you have 3 options

### 1- Host lavalink in your pc (only when running bot in the same pc)

- Run the lavalink.jar file in the lavalink folder, you can do this by doing: java jar lavalink.jar

### 2- Host lavalink in Replit

-  Go to: `repl.it/github/DarrenOfficial/lavalink-replit` and press import from Github
-  Run the replit
-  copy the replit url and put it to your bot
-  make sure you remove `https://` and always connect with the port 443

**The default port to connect is `443` and the default password is `maybeiwasboring`
You canâ€™t change the lavalink port! it will default to 443 due to how replit work.**

### How to keep the replit on with [freshping](https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring/)
Go to [freshping](https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring/), and set HTTP request to your app I.e. `https://lavalink-replit.sexsells.repl.co/metrics`
and it should show that it's online. if it's show offline, go to your application.yml and make sure metrics is set to on
